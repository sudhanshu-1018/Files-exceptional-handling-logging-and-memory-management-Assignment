    "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "Compiled languages translate the entire program before execution, while interpreted languages execute code line by line at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "Exception handling in Python is a way to manage runtime errors so the program continues running smoothly instead of crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "The finally block is used to execute cleanup code and it runs whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
    "Logging in Python records program activities such as errors and warnings to help with debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "The __del__ method is called when an object is destroyed and is mainly used to release resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the difference between import and from import in Python?\n",
    "The import statement loads the entire module, while from import brings specific items directly into the current program.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "Multiple exceptions can be handled by using multiple except blocks or grouping exceptions together.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
    "The with statement automatically closes the file after its operations are completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "Multithreading runs multiple threads in one process sharing memory, while multiprocessing runs separate processes with independent memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
    "Logging helps in debugging, tracking errors, and maintaining a history of program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "Memory management in Python refers to automatic allocation and deallocation of memory by the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "The basic steps include using try for risky code, except for handling errors, else for successful execution, and finally for cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "Memory management is important because it prevents memory leaks and improves program performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "The try block contains code that may cause errors, and the except block handles those errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "Python removes unused objects automatically using reference counting and garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "The else block runs only when no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
    "The common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "os.fork() duplicates the current process and works mainly on Unix systems, while multiprocessing provides a portable way to create multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
    "Closing a file ensures data is saved properly and system resources are freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
    "file.read() reads the entire file, while file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
    "The logging module is used to capture program messages and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
    "The os module is used for managing files and directories such as creating, deleting, and checking paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
    "Challenges include circular references, handling large objects, and performance overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
    "An exception can be raised manually using the raise keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
    "Multithreading improves responsiveness and allows multiple tasks to run at the same time.\n",
